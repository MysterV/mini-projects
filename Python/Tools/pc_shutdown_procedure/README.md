This is the beginning of a potentially never-ending journey to make an elaborate coping mechanism that shuts down my PC sequentially and gradually, bit by bit, to deal with my PC overdose.

1. [ ] Track user activity, IF the user is AFK, disable the script or make it wait for user activity, and the moment the user sits down, begin the process
    - [ ] make it forgiving if you accidentally move the mouse while just walking by
    - [ ] make a "PLEASE NO I CAN'T LET MY WORK GO UNSAVED/I'M LEAVING MY PC AFK OVERNIGHT" button that halts the procedure ONLY AND ONLY IF the user actually stays AFK
    - [ ] now... how do we track it if the user leaves a macro running that auto-clicks and does something while AFK? we can't just track mouse/keyboard input
2. overlay a cinematic black letterboxing that fades in, obstructing the view (could be paired with resolution change)

3. [ ] mute sound
    - [ ] Make it STAY muted, i.e. user can't just volume up

4. [ ] reduce color saturation  (maybe through custom color filters? like the ones for the colorblind?)

5. [ ] reduce resolution to the lowest possible
    - [ ] only use the standard resolutions if possible and keep the screen's aspect ratio

6. [ ] show a popup warning that the PC is about to shut down

7. [ ] lower screen brightness

8. [ ] then at the last second, revert all changes (to ensure everything is fine on next boot), and run a merciless "shutdown /f"

- [ ] BUT OF COURSE I can't just make it a binary switch 0-100, it has to *ease into it gradually* over the course of an hour or so
