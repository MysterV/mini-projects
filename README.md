# This repository contains various Myster's practice mini-projects
Various scripts and code snippets for various purposes: some small, some Big.
About 90% of it was hand-made by me, the other 10% sourced from the internet, and tweaked by me.

This repository is basically a catch-all for all the little scripts that were too small to bother and make a separate repository for.
If they do develop to a point where I feel they do deserve their own repo, I move them out of here.

## What you can find here
- `AutoHotKey` - various AHK scripts I found on the web and tweaked to suit my needs
- `Batch` - batch (command prompt) scripts
- `PowerShell` - PowerShell scripts designed to work with Task Scheduler
- `Python` - various mini projects, tools, minigames, etc.
- `Registry` - various Windows Registry scripts, made for Win11, but may or may not work on older versions
- `Web Dev` - my attempts at front-end stuff
- `YNA` - YNA tags for a [Discord bot named "42"](https://42.rockett.space/)
